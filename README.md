This is an example of how to test Ansible playbooks and roles locally with Docker. I took inspiration from [this article](https://medium.com/@ayeshasilvia/testing-ansible-playbook-in-a-docker-container-21628e9ee256)

## Running
Run the script `local_test.sh`. This must be run as a user with access to the Docker Daemon.
